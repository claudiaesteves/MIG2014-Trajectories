\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

We present a novel technique for computing trajectories for use in crowd patches. 
We can take an empty patch and generate trajectories within that can represent human motion. Our technique produces smooth collision free motion. This algorithm is slow to converge, especially with larger groups. Furthermore while our approach produces collision free trajectories it is lacking in other aspects of human motion. For one, agents can reach unrealistic speeds. Additionally agents can have abnormal motion that is not true to human behavior. In the future we plan to implement a more global approach that looks at more than just the closest agent and incorporates speed into the calculations. We hope that this will provide faster convergence in high density situations as will as fixing motion artifacts.
