\begin{abstract}

For many years now, simulating crowds in virtual environments have become more and more important. We want to see crowds in movies, TV shows, video-games, etc, and we want them to look good and natural.  An important part of crowd simulation is the way the people (or animals or any other moving agent inhabiting the environment) walk from one place to another. This paper concentrates in improving the crowd patches approach suggested by Yersin et al. ~\cite{Yersin:2009}. This method is based on the construction of animation blocks (called patches) stuck together to create a bigger and richer animation. The main purpose of this paper is to improve the way trajectories are created using an optimization-based method. Our main contributions include a better way to match the end points of trajectories using the Gale-Shapley algorithm~\cite{gale1962college} , a better method for collision avoidance that allows a more natural look to trajectories, as well as a proposal for smoothing the final trajectories using cubic splines. We show in the results several examples of patches and how they were improved by our method. We also discuss limitations and future work in the final sections.
