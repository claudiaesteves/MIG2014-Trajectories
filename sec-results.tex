\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}


The proposed trajectory generation algorithm was integrated into our own crowd patches platform in C++.
Each of the experiments described in the following paragraphs were for patches of size $A = 16m * 16m$ and period $\pi = 10sec$.
% We evaluate the proposed method both qualitative and quantitatively.

\textbf{Performance}
% As expected, increasing the number of initial control points increases the time required for the algorithm to converge to collision free trajectories (Figure~\ref{fig:res:performance}) due to increased crowd density.
All the performance measurements presented in this section were run on a single thread of an Intel Xeon quad core $2.8$ GHz processor having $8$GB of RAM (Figure~\ref{fig:res:performance}.
% For the results presented here , patches had an area of $A = 16m * 16m$ and period $\pi = 10sec$.
Each experiment consisted of placing equal numbers of entry/exit points in random positions around the border of the patches.
For each possible number of entry/exit points (ranging from $1-50$) the experiment was run multiple times ($20$) resulting in $1000$ different patches.
For each one of the experiments, time and number of iterations required for convergence were measured.
The results indicate a direct correlation of the number of iterations to the time required for convergence.
More importantly, increasing the number of control points decreases performance exponentially due to increased density.

Additionally, some of the experiments having more than a total of $60$ control points ($0.6\%$ of the experiments) had very slow convergence and were forced to stop at $2000$ iterations resulting in some collisions in the patch.
Examining the patches that failed to converge we observed that these was mainly due to the placement of the initial control points; if control points are clustered on a subset of the patch's sides matching between them is more difficult and non-optimal.
To account for this (assuming that the whole crowd patch generation is completely automatic) a better control point generation algorithm must be implemented.



% Performance was measured on a computer with an Intel Xeon quad core 2.8 GHz processor and 8GB of RAM. We found trajectories for patches with randomly generated entry and exit points. The patches all had base square of size 16 by 16. The period was 10 seconds. There were 20 samples for each number of agents between 1 and 50 for a total of 1000 samples. 994 of these were collision free. The other 6 were stopped after they reached 2000 iterations. We recorded the number of iterations required for collision free trajectories as well as the computation time in seconds.

\textbf{Example visualization}
The proposed method manages to create trajectories that are both free of collisions and with smooth motion; i.e., agents following these trajectories have speeds near regular humans comfort speeds and are also visually pleasing.
Figure~\ref{fig:res:steps} shows the trajectories generated by the proposed method for a patch consisting of $10$ input and $10$ output points and the intermediate steps; first input and output points are matched and connected with linear trajectories using Algorithm~{\ref{alg:stable-matching}}, then any collisions are handled using Algorithm~\ref{algo:control-points} and finally the generated trajectories are smoothed out.

\textbf{Adaptability to control point placement}
This method is able to adjust to the placement of the control points (Figure~\ref{fig:res:adapt-cp-placement}) aiming at the same time for good space coverage over the period of the patch.

\textbf{Adaptability to density}
The proposed method can adapt to different numbers of initial control points; i.e., it manages to generate smooth collision free trajectories for increasing larger numbers of trajectories (Figure~\ref{fig:res:inputs}).
Increasing the number of control points increases density and the time required for calculating these trajectories but recall that crowd patches are \emph{precomputed} and therefore during simulation time huge numbers of moving agents can be simulated at limited cost.
Again, trajectories aim to cover the patch's space.

\textbf{Collision Anticipation}
In the original work~\cite{Yersin:2009} Helbing's social forces \cite{Helbing:2005} approach was used to handle collisions.
One problem with that approach is the lack of anticipation by agents; agents handle collisions late resulting in unnatural looking trajectories even for simple scenarios such as the one in Figure~\ref{fig:res:helbing} whereas the proposed approach emulates better anticipatory behaviour.

		\textbf{Collision Anticipation}
		(a) Using the approach described in \cite{Yersin:2009} trajectories lack anticipation as they suddenly curve when collisions are near whereas
		(b) the proposed method generates trajectories with higher anticipation resulting in gradually changing direction.
% 		The proposed method manages to generate trajectories with better anticipatory behaviour to \cite{Yersin:2009}
% 		A comparison between both methods, shows the improvement in terms of anticipating a collision. (a) shows little anticipation, it modifies its trajectory until it is about to collide, whereas (b) starts modifying its trajectory gradually from the beginning.
